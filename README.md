# `gnucash-uk-vat`

## Introduction

This is a utility which manages HMRC (UK) VAT returns in accordance with
HMRC MTD directives for users of the GnuCash accounting system.  It can
study your GnuCash accounts, compare this with your HMRC VAT obligations,
and produce the VAT return to meet your obligations.  As an optional step,
once the VAT return is filed, a bill can be posted describing the VAT
owing, and posted to an Accounts Payable account.

## Status

This has only been tested with Linux. In theory, it should work with GnuCash
Python modules on any platform, but Python modules aren't included with Windows
or MacOS builds.

This is a command-line utility, with a GTK-based dialog mode which removes
the need to know about configuration files or command-line options.  At
the time of writing, this code has been tested against the Sandbox APIs.
You may be the first person to submit a production VAT return. :) Email
me, mark AT cyberapocalypse DOT co DOT uk, and I'll support you through
the process.

## Credentials

In order to use this, you need production credentials (client ID and secret)
for the VAT submission API.  HMRC does not permit these credentials to be
shared publicly:

> We have checked with our colleagues who look after HMRCâ€™s API
> Platform. They have advised that this is not allowed and would be likely
> to result in your Developer Hub application being blocked. We recommend
> that instead of sharing these credentials that you inform your users how
> they can register for their own Developer Hub application and use its
> credentials with your code.

You can either apply for production credentials using
the HMRC developer portal (you need to register), or contact me as I can
share a few credentials privately.

Developer hub: 
https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/using-the-hub

You click 'Get production credentials' and enter details about the
application.  I call this application `gnucash-uk-vat`.  When you apply for
credentials, HMRC will contact you to fill in an application.  You could
mention that the application has already been approved for production
credentials, and the application headers verified by testing on the
sandbox under the application identifier `d865cdd5-2aae-4630-9d2a-7c26ad797b2e`.

Once you have credentials, you should put them in the `config.json` file in
the `application` section placeholders.

## Help with this project

If you're an HMRC VAT user, and you use GnuCash, here are some ways
you can help:

- Try the `gnucash-uk-vat` options `--show-obligations`,
  `--show-open-obligations`, `--show-payments`, `--show-liabilities` and
  `--show-vat-return` options.
  Feedback on their successful operation would be appreciated.
- Try the `--show-account-data` mode.  Again, this is read-only, but interacts
  with the VAT API and your GnuCash accounts.  For all open VAT obligations, the
  output shows the 9 VAT return totals for the time period, along with
  individual account records   that combine to make these values.
  Feedback that the right data is returned.   I am not a VAT accountant.
- If you have been using GnuCash to keep VAT accounts, you can provide feedback
  on good ways to do this.

## Installing

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/cybermaggedon/gnucash-uk-vat
```

See [Installing](docs/installation.md).

## Usage

There are two modes:
- [Assist mode](docs/assist.md), which is a GTK-based dialog-driven.
  This automates everything including configuration file setup.
- [CLI mode](docs/cli.md), which is purely CLI-based and has no
  dependency on PyGTK.

## GnuCash accounts structure

See [Accounts](docs/accounts.md).

## Local test service

There is a local test service which allows you to emulate the HMRC VAT
service with test data under your control.

See [local test](docs/local-test.md).

## Sample accounts

A sample account file is included at `accounts/accounts.gnucash`.  This
account file contains some transactions dated in the 1Q17 quarter which match
the test data in HMRC's Sandbox.  There are also some transactions in 2020
which match the obligations in the `dummy-vat-service` data.

# Licences, Compliance, etc.

## Privacy

`gnucash-uk-vat` is hosted by you.  It runs on your computer, accesses
information from your accounts, and forwards data using the HMRC APIs.
Everything is within your control.  No other network systems are used, and no
information is transmitted to other parties.

Additional data (configuration and credentials) is stored on your
filesystem under your control and you should manage the credential
files as you would any password or other secret.
